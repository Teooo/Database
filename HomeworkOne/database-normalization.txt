Database normalization말s the process of organizing the마ttributes마nd맚ables맖f arelational database맚o minimize맋ata redundancy.
Normalization involves decomposing a table into less redundant (and smaller) tables but without losing information; defining맍oreign keys말n the old table referencing the맗rimary keys맖f the new ones. The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database using the defined foreign keys.
A typical example of normalization is that an entity's맛nique ID말s stored everywhere in the system but its name is held in only one table. The name can be updated more easily in one row of one table.
