Let's start by defining some common terminology. A database management system (DBMS) is the software which controls the storage, retrieval, deletion, security, and integrity of data within a database. An RDBMS is a DBMS which manages a relational database. A relational database stores data in tables. Tables are organized into columns, and each column stores one type of data (integer, real number, character strings, date, …).  The data for a single “instance” of a table is stored as a row.  For example, the Customer table would have columns such as CustomerNumber, FirstName, and Surname, and a row within that table would be something like {1701, “James”, “Kirk”}. 
Tables typically have keys, one or more columns that uniquely identify a row within the table, in the case of the Customer table the key would be CustomerNumber.  To improve access time to a data table you define an index on the table.  An index provides a quick way to look up data based on one or more columns in the table, just like the index of a book enables you to find specific information quickly. 
The most common use of RDBMSs is to implement simple CRUD – Create, Read, Update, and Delete – functionality.  For example an application could create a new order and insert it into your database. It could read an existing order, work with the data, and then update the database with the new information. It could also choose to delete an existing order, perhaps because the customer has cancelled it.  The vast majority of your interaction with an RDB will likely be to implement basic CRUD functionality.
